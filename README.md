- Windows 10 Pro version 22H2 Virtual Machine
  
<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Microsoft Azure Subscription
- Microsoft Azure Subscription Credit 

<h2>Installation, Setup, Resource Setup, Executing Functions</h2>

1. Having created our Windows 10 Virtual Machine within Microsoft Azure, I proceeded to enable IIS (Internet Information Services), then turned on the CGI (Common Gateway Interface) feature within IIS. Enabling the CGI feature allows us to run scripts and external programmes on our website that will use osTicket. In our case one of those languages will be PHP. CGI can be enabled by accessing Windows Features via control panel, then into IIS, then WWWS (World Wide Web Services), then Application Development Features, then enabling CGI.

2. At this stage I have installed a PHP Manager, Rewrite Module, Created a folder within our C: Drive named PHP, Unzipped PHP Extensions into this PHP folder. I then opened IIS as an Admin and registered PHP from within IIS. After this I installed osTicket and configured the "upload" folder into c:\inetpub\wwwroot. The reason for this is that we will have 2 domains for our osTicket installation. One will be for our Admin Panel and one for our User Panel. I then enabled some PHP extensions, namely php_imap.dll, php_intl.dll and php_opcache.dll.

4. I then installed HeidiSQL, created a session, connected to the session and created a database for osTicket. Within MySQL, which we installed earlier, chose the database osTicket, with the same password and username as created in HeidiSQL, and then installed osTicket.
